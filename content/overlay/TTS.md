# TTS

By default, your message will be read by the TTS system for free.
The TTS system will randomly assign you to a voice, and a pop-cat on the screen.
Changing voices currently requires you to gamble with `%refreshvoice`.

The TTS system supports modifiers: `[fast]`, `[slow]`, `[high]` and `[low]`.
For example, `[fast] i am [slow] really [high] cool`

The TTS system also supports sound effects, `(soundeffectname)`.
For example, `here, have some metal pipes. (metalpipes)`.
The list of supported sound effects can be found with `!sfx`.
