# Beepbox

Beepbox is a system involving:
- Discord Bot (known as "SongBot")
- The `<tagname>` chat prompt

Beepbox was conceptualised from the [beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co) site, which allows chatters to create any custom melody.

"SongBot" can be interacted with via the [#song](https://discord.com/channels/1324837719859396668/1330568746124709990) channel.

TODO: fill with more information about how to use songbot im too lazy

To play a song registered in beepbox, surround the name of the song in angle brackets: `<songname>`.
Playing a beepbox song will show a spinning vanor on the screen, and is free.
