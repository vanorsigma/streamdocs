# Kiki and Maki

Kiki and Maki are AI cats that appear on the stream in different forms.

## Kiki

Kiki is a very small fine-tuned LLM model that sometimes responds to chat messages.

She runs on a cloud server.

To directly interact with her, have the phrase "kiki" in your message anywhere.

Otherwise, she has a small probability of interacting with a random message.

Her responses are in [Kaomojis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaomoji) and emojis, which appear directly below [Chat Bullets]({{< relref "bullet.md" >}}).

## Maki

Maki is a very big system of components, which involves voice activation, speech-to-text, and some LLM features.

She runs on a combination of the same cloud server Kiki is on, and the [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai).

She can only hear vanor, and respond via overlay popups.

There is currentlyu no way for chat to interact with her.
