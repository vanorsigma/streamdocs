# Stock

The stream has a stock market.
Stocks are perishable to restarts (unless vanor closes the market with `%closemarket`), but is the easiest way to earn money.

The stock market currently tracks vanor's heartrate, which will increase / decrease your value.

Use `%invest <amount>` to invest, and `%uninvest <amount>` to uninvest.
